## 📚 JavaDocs Documentation

This project uses **JavaDoc** to create clean, browsable documentation for all the classes and methods. We added JavaDoc-style comments to each class (`Main`, `UserInfo`, etc.), explaining what the class does, its authorship, and how each method works.

The documentation was generated using the following command:

```bash
javadoc -d docs src/*.java
